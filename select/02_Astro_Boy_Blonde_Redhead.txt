If you insist on situations that make you cry
It's not real
It can be fear
It's in your eyes
It can be here
The complications affect your mind

Mistake? One more
A fewer days
A fewer time
Astro Boy

What I'm trying to say is simple
The emotions go something like this
I want you
I want your house
I kiss you
I
I was always there
I was there
I was alone
I was small
It was real
It's so true
I can feel, you can feel
I

How mere
How mere
How mere
How mere

If I insist on situations that make you cry
It's not real
It can be fear
It's in your eyes
It can be here
The complications affect your mind

Just take one more
A fewer days
A fewer time
