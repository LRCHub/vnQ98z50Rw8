Oh, all I want to know
All I want
With just a touch of my burning hand
I sent my astro zombies to rape this land
Prime directive, exterminate
The whole human race
And your face just drops in a pile of flesh
And then your heart, heart pounds
Till it pumps in death
Prime directive, exterminate
Whatever stands left
And all I wanted to say
And all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for
Hey, me or you
And all I wanted to say
And all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for
Hey, me or you
Oh, all I want to know
All I want
With just a touch of my burning hand
Gonna live my life to destroy your world
Prime directive, exterminate
The whole fuckin' race
And your face just drops in a pile of flesh
And your heart, heart pounds
Till it pumps in death
Prime directive, exterminate
The whole fuckin' race
All I wanted to say
And all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for
Hey, me or you
All I wanted to say
And all I gotta do
Who'd I do this for
Hey, me or you
Oh, all I want to know
All I want
